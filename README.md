# SafeStreets

The first upload (SafeStreets.als) is a project done by some my colleagues from Politecnico di Milano.
My assignment is to review their project and find weaknesses and strengths. 
So the uploads following the first one will be the progress of my work on their Alloy code.


SafeStreets.als: code to be analyzed /n
SafeStreets2.0.als: code format correction (already done in part in SafeStreets.als)
